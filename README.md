Jupyter Notebook with three Python Scripts that train MLP Models with different data types, functions and results.

## üìã Prerequisites
First of all, you need to be able to open/run these Scripts, to do so, you can either way use the console or use an IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This are the steps to do it in both options.
- **Console**:
  Install the latest [Python](https://www.python.org/) version.
  Then, open a terminal and install Jupyter Notebook with the following command:
  ```
  pip install jupyter
  ```
  If its fails or you have a another version of Python:
  ```
  py -m pip install jupyter
  ```
- **VS Code**:
  Go to the extension Marketplace and install the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extensions.

To run the scripts, in both console or IDE, you **must** install the following dependencies with the terminal:
```
pip install torch matplotlib numpy
```
If its fails or you have a another version of Python:
```
py -m pip install torch matplotlib numpy
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
Open the Jupyter Notebook with VS Code or with it's web application running this command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
If its fails or you have a another version of Python:
```
py -m jupyter notebook
```
Then, the app will open automaticly in your default browser.

## üöÄ Project Usage Explanation
Follow the guide and Run the Python Code Cells in the Jupyter Notebook to train and see the results of the MLP Models.

The three Scripts generate one MLP Model with it's own functionalities and data types.

To test and change results, ajust the Model parameters and training settings (marked in comments).

Their funcionality is explained in each's Python Script.
